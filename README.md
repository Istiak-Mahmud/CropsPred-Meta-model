# Crops Prediction Using Machine Learning: A Cost-Effective Embedded System with a Metamodel Approach

This is an implementation of the paper. The hardware files, software files and meta-model files are attached in this repo. 

# Abstract

Agriculture is one of the world's largest and most significant sectors, therefore improving output levels is critical for the security and health of a country’s population. Predicting suitable crops for a certain land is one of agriculture’s most difficult problems. Furthermore, climates are quickly changing nowadays. Although there have been some developments and research, they have solely focused on the hardware or software aspects. There is a scarcity of study on the embedded system, which is a complete system solution consisting of hardware and software. Based on a machine learning meta-model, this research provided a cost-effective and simple crop prediction embedded solution. The meta-model is a combination of four different machine learning models. The hardware is used to measure N, P, K, pH, Humidity, and Temperature, which are all important soil parameters. There used an ATtiny microcontroller as the main controller, a custom pH sensor, DHT11, and HC-05 as major hardware components. For output screening, there is an android app with a meta-model. The app will finally predict the suitable crops for a particular land.
